Readmepart1The program of part1 is designed to sort the information more conveniently.In this example, the program sort the price of ticket by status of people. We divide the status of group of peopole by group who bought a ticket in advanced, group of people who bought a ticket in advanced with a student status, and people who bought a ticket with walkup. In sense, the price of walkup tickets is the most expensive, ticket in advanced is the cheapest, and student should get a more discount. Many conditions of different buying ticket categories have a common information since some of the buying ticket categories share the information. In order to sort the information, we used the class inheritance. The ticket in advanced is implemented to regular ticket to represent the cheaper price. The student ticket in advanced is implemented to ticket in advanced to represent the cheaper price on the status of ticket in advanced. Walkup ticket is implement to Regular represent price of walkup is more expensive then buying a regular ticket.  What it actually print out is 15 tickets first 3 are the regular tickets with price, other next two is walkup ticket with price, and other three is ticket in advanced with a 30days, 15days, and 3days prior, and the other three is ticket in advanced as a student with 30days, 15days, and 3days prior, and next other four is back to price for regular tickets. And then the total profit from selling all tickets in the array.
